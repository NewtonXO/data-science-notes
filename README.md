# 📚 Data Science Learning Repository

This repository tracks my transition from software development into data science. It’s both a personal learning vault and a growing portfolio of coding projects and data analyses.

## 🎯 Goals

* Build a strong foundation in data science concepts (math, statistics, machine learning, etc.).
* Practice coding with Python, SQL, R and relevant data science libraries.
* Complete small and medium data projects to showcase practical skills.
* Prepare for a data analyst internship as a first step toward a full data scientist role.

## ✅ What's Included So Far

This repository is currently a work in progress. It will serve as my personal learning hub as I transition into data science.

At the moment, it includes:

* 📓 My first learning notes from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

More content will be added over time as I continue learning and practicing.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

* Complete and upload detailed notes from the Google Analytics certificate.
* Start Python and SQL practice notebooks.
* Gradually expand into data projects and job prep materials.

## ⭐ Why This Repo Is Public

Keeping this repository public helps me:

* Showcase my learning journey to potential employers.
* Build a portfolio of real work.
* Hold myself accountable.
* Connect with others in the data science community.
